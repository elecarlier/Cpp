/*
1) Group the elements of X into [n/2] pairs of elements, arbitrarily, leaving one element unpaired if there is an odd number of elements.
2) Perform [n/2] comparisons, one per pair, to determine the larger of the two elements in each pair.
3) Recursively sort the [n/2] larger elements from each pair, creating a sorted sequence S of [n/2] of the input elements, in ascending order, using the merge-insertion sort.
4) Insert at the start of S the element that was paired with the first and smallest element of S
5) Insert the remaining [n/2] - 1 elements of Xâˆ–S into S. one at a time, with a specially chosen insertion  Use binary search in subsequences of S (as described below) to determine the position at which each element should be inserted.


Group the elements of X into [n/2] pairs of elements -> if oddm leave the last element unpair
Put the larger one of the pair on the front
recursively sort the [n/2] larger elements from each pair
